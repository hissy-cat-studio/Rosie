Designer Notes:

Rosie was inspired by two thoughts. 

1. Theme - WWII like most wars, boils down to the attritation of human and material resources. I grew up as a military brat, my father was in the Navy and my mother always worked outside the home. To me it was just normal that women worked and equally supported a family, i did not know any different. My mother has had a major influinece on me and today she is a great role modle to my two daughters. So in a small way, i want to express my love and admiration to her with this game. A game to highlight the contribution of the millions of women who helped win WWII because of their efforts to produce the vital resources needed by the Allies. 

2. Mechanics - I bought and played Century Spice Road, and loved the simple game play, but the contract fullfillment was the spark for Rosie i needed. Contract fullfillment for victory points fits the theme perfectly. The spices needed to fullfill a contract in Century Spice Road, became the raw materials needed to build the Aircraft, Tanks, War Ships, and Munitions needed to fullfill government contracts to support the war efforts. I scrapped Century Spice Roads Card drafting-engine building mechanic and needed to design a game engine around the factory production line to tie everything back to the game's theme.
